# Adding a language — runbook (whatwhatboy site)

**Purpose:** say "add \<language\>" and this file is all that's needed to do it correctly.
Everything lives in `languages/`. There is no build step.

---

## The 4 steps

### 1. Register it in the engine

[i18n.js](i18n.js) → the `LANGS` array near the top. Append:

```js
{ code: 'nl', label: 'NL', native: 'Nederlands' }
```

- `code` — ISO 639-1, lowercase, two letters. Must match the dictionary filename.
- `label` — the badge text, uppercase, two letters.
- `native` — the language's own name, **written in that language** (Deutsch, not German). This is what users scan for, so it must never be translated.

Order in this array is the order shown in the dropdown and the first-visit picker. English stays first.

### 2. Draw a flag

Same file → the `FLAGS` map. Plain SVG shapes on a **`0 0 60 40`** canvas (no `<svg>` wrapper — that is added for you):

```js
nl: '<rect width="60" height="40" fill="#fff"/>' +
    '<rect width="60" height="13.33" fill="#AE1C28"/>' +
    '<rect y="26.67" width="60" height="13.33" fill="#21468B"/>',
```

**Do not use emoji flags.** Windows ships no flag glyphs, so 🇳🇱 renders as the letters "NL". That is the entire reason these are drawn.

Handy geometry on the 60×40 canvas:
- horizontal thirds → `y=0 / 13.33 / 26.67`, each `height="13.33"`
- vertical thirds → `x=0 / 20 / 40`, each `width="20"`
- halves → `height="20"` or `width="30"`
- centred disc → `<circle cx="30" cy="20" r="12"/>`
- a five-pointed star helper already exists: `star(x, y, radius, rotation)`

Skipping the flag is allowed — the entry still works, it just shows without one.

### 3. Create the dictionary

Copy an existing file, e.g. `es.js` → `nl.js`, and change **both** occurrences of the code at the bottom:

```js
if (window.__scoobyI18n) window.__scoobyI18n.register('nl', t);
else (window.__scoobyI18nQueue = window.__scoobyI18nQueue || []).push(['nl', t]);
```

Then translate the values. **Keys are the English source text and must never change** — they are what the runtime looks up.

Keep the key set identical to `es.js` so every language stays in step. Verify with:

```bash
node i18n-tools/i18n-verify.js
```

### 4. Check it

```bash
node --check languages/nl.js      # parses
node i18n-tools/i18n-verify.js         # 0 dead keys, key count matches the others
node i18n-tools/i18n-update.js         # drift report
```

Then load any page, open the selector, pick the language, and confirm the nav and footer change.

## Translation conventions

These are followed by every existing dictionary — match them.

**Leave in English** — cheat jargon, because that is what these communities actually say in every language:

> aimbot · ESP · triggerbot · chams · ragebot · legitbot · silent aim · magic bullet · noclip · wallhack · speedhack · HWID · spoofer

**Also leave alone** — brand and product names:

> Scooby · FiveM · RedM · GTA 5 · RDR2 · CS2 · GMOD · S&box · Discord · Telegram · PayPal · BattlEye · Premium · Premium Plus · Lua

**Do translate** — descriptive feature names ("Infinite Ammo", "Never Wanted", "Money Rain"), all UI text, all prose, page titles and meta descriptions.

**Register:** informal/second-person, matching the English. This is a gaming audience, not a bank.

**Watch out for:**
- The key `"© 2026 Scooby. All rights reserved."` — translate the sentence, keep the `©` and the year.
- Keys containing quotes, e.g. `"\"Unlock Link\""` — that button label stays in English because it is the literal text on a third-party page.
- Sentence-fragment keys like `"Click the"` / `"button to reveal your key"` — these join around a bolded element, so keep them as fragments that still read correctly in sequence.
- CJK and Thai: no space before punctuation, and use full-width colons (：) where natural.

## Right-to-left languages

**RTL is supported.** Mark the language in `LANGS` and the engine handles the rest:

```js
{ code: 'fa', label: 'FA', native: 'فارسی', rtl: true }
```

On switching, the engine sets `dir="rtl"` on `<html>` alongside `lang`. The selector's dropdown and floating pill anchor flips from `left` to `right` so it stays on screen, and the option rows right-align. Verified: the selector moves from x=74 to x=1119 on a 1280px viewport, and the dropdown stays inside the viewport.

One caveat worth knowing: `dir="rtl"` mirrors normal document flow, but any **page CSS that hard-codes `left`/`right`** (rather than `inline-start`/`inline-end`) will not mirror on its own. The shared chrome is fine; if a specific page looks off in Arabic or Hebrew, that is where to look.

## Current state

All 20 dictionaries are generated from one shared table in
[../i18n-tools/build-chrome.js](../i18n-tools/build-chrome.js) — **edit that table,
not the generated files**, then re-run:

```bash
node i18n-tools/build-chrome.js
```

They currently cover the **site chrome** — the sidebar navigation, footer and
shared labels, 56 entries appearing on nearly all 85 pages.

Adding a language here therefore means adding one `code:"translation"` pair per
row of that table, plus the `LANGS` and `FLAGS` entries described above. There is
no separate dictionary file to hand-write.

To go deeper than the chrome, use the round-trip workflow instead:

```bash
node i18n-tools/i18n-update.js --apply    # writes languages/_todo/<lang>.js
# translate the values there
node i18n-tools/i18n-update.js --merge
```

## Removing a language

Delete `languages/<code>.js`, then remove its `LANGS` entry and its `FLAGS` entry. Anyone who had it saved falls back to English automatically on their next visit.
